# Evaluation

Three metrics. Each is one script, one process, one JSON.

| script | measures |
|---|---|
| `solo.py` | the senior alone: pass@k over n independent samples per problem |
| `handoff.py` | senior and junior alternating at every `\n\n`, one reasoning step each, under a shared token budget, with the team's finished answer graded |
| `legibility.py` | the frozen junior's mean per-token cross-entropy, in nats, over the senior's chain of thought |

`handoff.py` needs two GPUs, one engine per card. `solo.py` and `legibility.py` need one.

## Run

```bash
MODEL=/path/to/senior TAG=step_120 RESULTS_ROOT=results/tandem bash run_all.sh
```

Runs all three in order and writes `results/tandem/step_120/{solo,handoff,legibility}.json`. A
phase whose JSON exists is skipped, so the command is safe to rerun. `JUNIOR` defaults to
`BASE_MODEL` from `train/env.sh`; `BENCHMARKS`, `N`, `LIMIT` and `GPU_UTIL` are also overridable.

Individually:

```bash
python solo.py --model $SENIOR --out results/tandem/step_120/solo.json --n 8

python handoff.py --senior $SENIOR --junior Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 \
  --out results/tandem/step_120/handoff.json --n 8

python legibility.py --solo results/tandem/step_120/solo.json \
  --junior Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 \
  --out results/tandem/step_120/legibility.json
```

`legibility.py` reads the generations `solo.py` saved, so run solo first.

## Sampling

Temperature 0.7, top_p 0.8, top_k 20, max_tokens 3000, defined once in `config.py`. Every script
builds `SamplingParams` through `config.sampling_params()`, which refuses per call overrides of
the three decoding parameters. `legibility.py` does not sample; it uses `config.scoring_params()`,
temperature 0 with `prompt_logprobs`.

If you add a script, use the factory. vLLM defaults `top_k` to -1, so a script that imports the
constants but builds its own `SamplingParams` drops the top_k setting without an error.

## Benchmarks

`data/eval/` ships seven parquets. `--benchmarks` takes a comma separated list of directory names;
the default evaluates AIME 2024--2026, AMC 2023--2025, Minerva, and OlympiadBench. MATH500 is
available as an optional benchmark.

Macro averages give each of these four benchmarks equal weight. AIME 2024, 2025, and 2026 are
pooled before computing the AIME result. Outputs retain the individual years and add
`by_benchmark` with the pooled AIME entry, `aime24_26`; `macro` and `macro_ce` average the
benchmark entries. When `--benchmarks` selects a subset, the average uses only the selected
benchmark groups.
