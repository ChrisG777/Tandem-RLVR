# Qwen3.5 execution profiling

The slow 200-step campaigns were cancelled at the user's request; their saved
checkpoints remain intact. Target: approximately 24 GPU-hours per complete run,
including validation/checkpoint overhead, with the original objective, batches,
rollout count, response budget, and full-weight training retained.

`train/profile_qwen35.py` is an opt-in diagnostic import for the existing trainer:
set `QWEN35_PROFILE_DIR=DIR` and
`actor_rollout_ref.model.external_lib=train.profile_qwen35`. It synchronizes and
times existing forward/backward/optimizer calls, saving JSONL and a bounded
PyTorch trace of the second backward. It does not implement a training loop.

Candidate optimization: opt-in backport of upstream verl's
`_gradient_sync_context` from commit
`1d367a4f459a43768f76312c0d3430a99ec46b8c`, using FSDP2's native
`set_requires_gradient_sync`. Set
`+actor_rollout_ref.actor.fsdp_config.use_no_sync_for_gradient_accumulation=True`.
The default remains false to preserve existing runs. Gradient accumulation then
keeps gradients on GPU until the final microbatch, trading memory for fewer
CPU transfers. `tests/test_fsdp2_offload_accumulation.py` checks gradients and
AdamW updates against sync-every-microbatch on a small full-weight model.
This candidate is not yet validated for the full Qwen3.5 run.
